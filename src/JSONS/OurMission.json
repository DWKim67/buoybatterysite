Essentially, renewable sources like wind turbines are still collecting energy during off-peak times (such as overnight) and are too expensive to store. This power waste alone is equivalent to $1 billion dollars in 2016 alone. After evaluating the problem at hand, we asked ourselves, “how might we sustainably store excess power generated during off-peak usage times in order to apply this power during peak usage times?”",
